## Project Overview
- This repository demonstrates three different approaches to handling client-server communication in Java:

- SingleThreaded: Basic server that processes requests sequentially.
- MultiThreaded: Server that creates a new thread for each incoming request. 
- ThreadPool: Server that uses a fixed pool of reusable threads for efficient request handling.

# Features
- Three Server Implementations:
  - Single-threaded (sequential processing)
  - Multi-threaded (one thread per request)
  - ThreadPool (fixed reusable threads)

# Architecture:
- Separates client and server logic.
- Easy to extend for custom use cases.

# Technologies Used
- Java: Core implementation language.
- Java Threading API: For multi-threading and thread pooling.

# Setup
- Prerequisites
  -  Java JDK 8 or later installed.
